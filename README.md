### Project Description

This project is an interactive, AI-powered dashboard designed to help organizations extract insights from their internal datasets using natural language queries. Built with LangChain, OpenAI, Pandas, and Streamlit, the assistant performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), retrieves relevant information using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and visualizes trendsâ€”all through a conversational interface.

###  Features

-  Natural language querying over structured datasets
-  Automated EDA and trend analysis
-  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for contextual answers
-  Streamlit-powered dashboard with interactive charts
-  Modular architecture for easy extension and customization


The assistant responds with data-backed answers, charts, and summaries, making business intelligence accessible to non-technical users.
